     Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are allow to developers to create complex functionality more easily. They abstract more complex code away from you, providing some easier syntax to use in its place.

     APIs in client-side JavaScript -:

     - Browser APIs are built into your web browser and are able to expose data from the browser and surrounding computer environment and do useful complex things with it. For example, the Web Audio API provides JavaScript constructs for manipulating audio in the browser â€” taking an audio track, altering its volume, applying effects to it, etc. 
    
     - Third-party APIs are not built into the browser by default, and you generally have to retrieve their code and information from somewhere on the Web. For example, the Twitter API allows you to do things like displaying your latest tweets on your website. It provides a special set of constructs you can use to query the Twitter service and return specific information.
